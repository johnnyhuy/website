After working in enterprise environments, I've learned that success isn't just about writing brilliant code or having the best technical skills. It's about understanding power dynamics, building social capital, and knowing when to dive headfirst into problems others avoid. This isn't the sanitised version of career advice you'll find in most places‚Äîit's the messy, honest truth about what actually works.

## The 50-20-30 Rule of Professional Success

Here's something most people won't tell you: **50% of success is simply showing up**. Not just physically being there, but being present, engaged, and ready to tackle whatever comes your way. The remaining breakdown? 30% is planning and understanding the landscape, and the final 20% is execution and feedback.

This might sound overly simplistic, but I've watched brilliant engineers fail because they couldn't master the "showing up" part. They'd disappear into their code caves, emerge with perfect solutions, then wonder why their work didn't get the recognition it deserved.

The reality is that visibility and engagement matter as much as technical competence. You need to be in the room where decisions happen, not just the room where code gets written.

## Navigating the Social Minefield

Enterprise environments are essentially large social groups with complex hierarchies and unwritten rules. You'll encounter people who "kiss up and kick down," problematic personalities, and situations where your technical expertise alone won't save you.

> [!TIP]
> You can be pinned as either a martyr or a target in these social dynamics. I've seen both, and neither is particularly pleasant. The difference often comes down to how you build and leverage social capital.

### Learning from Exit Interviews

One of my most valuable practices is speaking with people who are leaving the company. They'll tell you things that would never surface in normal conversation‚Äîwho the real decision-makers are, which projects are actually going nowhere, and which managers to avoid. 

It's uncomfortable to acknowledge, but not everyone comes to work with good intentions. Some people will see your drive and competence as a threat. Having allies who can give you the real story helps you navigate these situations before they become career-limiting problems.

## The Archaeology Approach to Onboarding

When I start at a new idea or take on a new project, I don't jump straight into solutions. Instead, I do what I call "archaeology"‚Äîdigging wide before digging deep.

This means understanding:
- Why this particular system exists
- Who built it and what constraints they faced  
- What previous attempts were made to solve similar problems
- Where the political landmines are buried

There's always a grace period when you're new where people don't expect immediate output. Most people waste this by trying to ship something quickly to prove themselves. I use it to build a mental map of the technical and social landscape.

**The delayed gratification is worth it.** You'll wear yourself out doing this archaeological work, but the context you gain pays dividends for months afterwards. You'll understand not just what to build, but why it matters and who needs to be convinced.

## Embracing the Boring Bits

Here's where my experience diverges from the typical career advice: **as a senior engineer, I actively seek out the boring work**. Documentation, incident response, training materials, cleanup tasks that everyone else avoids‚ÄîI call it "janitor work," and I dive in headfirst.

Why? Because these are often the tasks that create the most value but get the least recognition. When you're the person who consistently handles the unglamorous but critical work, you become indispensable. You also gain deep insights into how systems actually work, not just how they're supposed to work.

Plus, there's creativity to be found even in the mundane. Writing good documentation is a design challenge. Incident response requires detective skills. Training materials need storytelling ability. 

## The Wizard Phenomenon

Throughout my career, I've been fortunate to work with people I consider "wizards"‚Äîengineers who seem to have an almost supernatural ability to understand complex systems and make the right technical decisions. Early in my career, I had mentors who helped me avoid the career trauma that comes from bad management or toxic environments.

**Observation is everything.** I learned more by watching how these wizards approached problems, communicated with different stakeholders, and built influence than I ever did from formal training. They showed me that technical excellence alone isn't enough‚Äîyou need to understand the human systems as well.

Now people sometimes reach out to me for advice, which suggests I might be developing some wizard-like qualities myself. The responsibility of that role isn't lost on me.

## Building Conviction and Resilience

One thing that's served me well is maintaining strong conviction that I can bounce back from setbacks. If I lost my job tomorrow, I'm confident I could land on my feet. This isn't arrogance‚Äîit's based on a track record of learning quickly, building relationships, and consistently delivering value.

**This conviction changes how you operate.** When you're not operating from fear, you can take calculated risks, speak up about problems, and stand firm on your principles. You can afford to be honest about trade-offs and limitations rather than just telling people what they want to hear.

Building this confidence requires proving to yourself repeatedly that you can handle difficult situations. Every time you successfully navigate a crisis, deal with a difficult person, or deliver under pressure, you add to your reservoir of self-assurance.

## The Risk-Taker Label

People sometimes tell me I'm a risk-taker because of my age or approach to problems. I don't see it that way. What others perceive as risk-taking is usually just thorough preparation combined with decisive action.

When I "throw myself headfirst" into problems, it's not reckless‚Äîit's because I've done the archaeology work. I understand the context, I've identified the key stakeholders, and I have a plan. The speed of execution might look risky from the outside, but it's actually quite calculated.

## From Hobby to Career

My approach to professional challenges was shaped by early experiences building online communities‚Äîfirst a Minecraft server called Cordite when I was 14, then moving on to Garry's Mod communities. These weren't just hobbies; they were crash courses in project management, community building, and technical problem-solving.

**Making mistakes early and cheaply** taught me lessons that transferred directly to enterprise environments. Running an online community means dealing with difficult people, making resource allocation decisions, and balancing multiple stakeholder interests‚Äîsound familiar?

Those experiences taught me that technical problems are rarely just technical. There's always a human element, political considerations, and competing priorities. Learning to navigate these early gave me a significant advantage in professional settings.

## The Long Game

Building competitive advantage in enterprise environments isn't about optimising for short-term wins. It's about:

- **Consistently delivering value** in ways that matter to the business
- **Building genuine relationships** with people across different functions
- **Developing deep expertise** in areas that are strategically important
- **Taking on responsibilities** that others avoid but that create real impact
- **Maintaining your principles** while being pragmatic about execution

The goal isn't to play politics or manipulate situations to your advantage. It's to become genuinely valuable to the organisation while staying true to your own values and maintaining your technical edge.

## What's Next

I'm still learning, still making mistakes, and still figuring out how to balance technical leadership with the human aspects of the job. The difference now is that I have a framework for thinking about these challenges and a track record of working through them successfully.

If you're early in your career, focus on the fundamentals: show up consistently, dig deep into understanding context, and don't be afraid of the boring work. If you're more experienced, remember that your role isn't just to solve technical problems‚Äîit's to help others navigate the complexity of building software in large organisations.

Either way, remember that **50% of success is just showing up**. The rest, you can figure out as you go.
