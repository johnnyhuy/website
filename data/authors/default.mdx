After over 6 years in the tech wilderness, I've found myself gravitating toward being the person who gets thrown into the deep end of complex problems. Not because I'm some tech wizard, but because I enjoy piecing together knowledge from different domains to build something that actually works. These days, I focus on creating systems that help my teammates succeed and sharing what I've learned along the way.
