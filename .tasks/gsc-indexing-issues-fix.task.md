# gsc-indexing-issues-fix

## Task Overview

**Created:** `2025-05-28`  
**Status:** `Planning`

## Problem Statement

Google Search Console has identified multiple indexing issues preventing pages from being indexed and appearing in search results:

1. **Duplicate without user-selected canonical** (1 page) - New critical issue
2. **Alternate page with proper canonical tag** (12 pages) - Expected behavior
3. **Blocked due to access forbidden (403)** (2 pages) - Server access issue
4. **Blocked by robots.txt** (2 pages) - Configuration issue
5. **Page with redirect** (1 page) - Redirect chain issue
6. **Blocked due to unauthorized request (401)** (1 page) - Authentication issue
7. **Crawled - currently not indexed** (8 pages) - Content quality/relevance issue

These issues are preventing valuable content from being discovered and indexed by Google, potentially impacting organic traffic and search visibility.
