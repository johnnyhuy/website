# Best Practices
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid any and enums; use explicit types and maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
- Enable strict mode in TypeScript for better type safety.

# Code Style & Formatting
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Use dash-case for React component file names (e.g., user-card.tsx, not UserCard.tsx).
- Prefer named exports for components.
- Use Prettier for consistent code formatting.

# Architecture
- Correctly determine when to use server vs. client components in Next.js.

# Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use "dark:" for dark mode classes
- Ensure high accessibility (a11y) standards using ARIA roles and native accessibility props.

# Cascade
- Apply the fix without confirmation unless you need more information
